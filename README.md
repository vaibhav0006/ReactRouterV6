Middleware in Express.js is a function that is executed between the time a request is received by the server and the time a response is sent back to the client. 

middleware in web development is like a series of filters or processing steps that a request passes through before reaching its final destination (route handler). Each middleware can perform certain tasks, modify the request or response, or terminate the request-response cycle.

Middleware functions are reusable. You can create a middleware function once and use it in multiple places in your application.

Middleware functions can be used to do things like:
Logging
Authentication and Authorization
Error Handling
Parsing Request Data
Security
Compression and Response Optimization
Caching
Request Modification
Response Modification
Rate Limiting and Throttling
Localization
Routing
